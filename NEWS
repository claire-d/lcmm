Changes in Version 1.7.1 (2015-02-25):


* Function plot now includes a which="fit" option to plot observed and predicted trajectories stemming from a hlme, lcmm, Jointlcmm or multlcmm object.

* Function 'predictlink' replaces deprecated function 'link.confint' 

* Function 'plot' gathers deprecated functions 'plot.linkfunction', 'plot.baselinerisk', 'plot.survival', 'plot.fit' together 



Changes in Version 1.7.0 (2015-02-13):

* The function 'Jointlcmm' now allows competing risks data for the survival part and is also available for non-Gaussian longitudinal data. All existing methods for Jointlcmm objects (except EPOCE and Diffepoce functions) are adapted to the new framework. 

* Functions 'link.confint', 'plot.linkfunction', 'predictL' are now available for Jointlcmm objects.

* The new functions 'incidcum' and 'plot.incidcum' respectively compute and plot the cumulative incidence associated to each competing event for Jointlcmm object.

* The new function 'fitY' computes the marginal predicted values of longitudinal outcomes in their natural scale for lcmm or multlcmm objects.

* Bug identified and solved in 'dynpred' function when used with a joint model assuming proportional hasards between latent classes.

* The Makevars file now allows compilation of the package with parallel make.



Changes in Version 1.6.5 & 1.6.6 (2014-09-10):

* bug solved regarding installation problem with parallel make



Changes in Version 1.6.4 (2014-04-11):

* The new functions 'dynpred' and 'plot.dynpred' respectively compute and plot individual dynamic predictions obtained from a joint latent class model estimated by Jointlcmm.

* The new function 'VarCovRE' computes the standard errors of the parameters of variance-covariance of the random effects for a hlme, lcmm, Jointlcmm or multlcmm object

* The new function 'WaldMult' computes multivariate Wald tests and Wald tests for combinations of parameters from hlme, lcmm, Jointlcmm or multlcmm object

* The new function 'VarExpl' computes the percentages of variance explained by the linear regression for a hlme, lcmm, Jointlclmm or multlcmm object

* The new functions 'estimates' and 'VarCov' get respectively all parameters estimated and their variance-covariance matrix for a hlme, lcmm, Jointlcmm or multlcmm object

* Function 'summary' now returns the table containing the results about the fixed effects in the longitudinal model 

* All plots consider now the ... options

* Functions plot.linkfunction and plot.predict have now an add argument

* Function multlcmm now allows "splines" or "Splines" specification for the link functions

* Functions 'lcmm' and 'multlcmm' now compute the transformations even if the maximum number of iterations is reached without convergence

* bug identified and solved in multlcmm when the response variables are not integers

* bug identified and solved in multlcmm when using contrast

* bug identified and solved in plot.linkfunction for the y axes positions

* bug identified and solved in hlme, lcmm, Jointlcmm and multlcmm when including interactions in 'mixture'.




Changes in Version 1.6.2 (2013-03-06):

* The new function 'multlcmm' now estimates latent process mixed models for multivariate curvilinear longitudinal outcomes (with link functions: linear, beta or splines). Various post-fit computation and output functions are also available including plot.linkfunction, predictY, predictL, etc

* All the functions hlme, lcmm, Jointlcmm include a 'cor' option for including a brownian motion or a first-order autoregressive error process in addition to the independent errors of measurement

* bug identified and solved in predictL,predictY and plot.predict when used with factor covariate


Changes in Version 1.5.8 (2012-10-01):

* bug identified and solved in predictY.lcmm when used with a 'splines' link function and an outcome with minimum value not at 0


Changes in Version 1.5.7 (2012-07-24):

* The function 'predictY' now computes the predicted values (possibly class-specific) of the longitudinal outcome not only from a lcmm object but also from a hlme or a Jointlcmm object for a specified profile of covariates.

* bug identified and solved in predictY.lcmm when used with a 'threshold' link function and a Monte Carlo method


Changes in Version 1.5.6 (2012-07-16):

* missing data handled in hlme, lcmm and Jointlcmm using 'na.action' with attributes 1 for 'na.omit' or 2 for 'na.fail'

* The new function 'predictY.lcmm' computes predicted values of a lcmm object in the natural outcome scale for a specified profile of covariates, and also provides confidence bands using a Monte Carlo method.

* bugs in epoce computation solved (with splines baseline risk function, and/or NaN values under solaris system)

* bug identified and solved in summary functions regarding the labels of covariate effects in peculiar cases


Changes in Version 1.5.2 (2012-04-06):

* improved variable specification in the estimating functions Jointlcmm, lcmm and hlme with 
	- categorical variables using factor() 
	- variables entered as functions using I() 
	- interaction terms using "*" and ":"

* computation of the predictive accuracy measure EPOCE from a Jointlcmm object either on the training data or on external data (post-fit functions epoce and Diffepoce)

* for discrete outcomes, lcmm function now computates the posterior discrete log-likelihood and the universal approximate cross-validation criterion (UACV)

* Jointlcmm now includes two parameterizations of I-splines and piecewise-constant baseline risks functions to ensure positive risks: either log/exp or sqrt/square (option logscale=).
