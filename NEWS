News about R package lcmm :
---------------------------

Changes in Version 1.5 (2012-04-06):

째 improved variable specification in the estimating functions Jointlcmm, lcmm and hlme with 
	- categorical variables using factor() 
	- variables entered as functions using I() 
	- interaction terms using "*" and ":"

째 computation of the predictive accuracy measure EPOCE from a Jointlcmm object either on the training data or on external data (post-fit functions epoce and Diffepoce)

째 for discrete outcomes, lcmm function now computates the posterior discrete log-likelihood and the universal approximate cross-validation criterion (UACV)

째 Jointlcmm now includes two parameterizations of I-splines and piecewise-constant baseline risks functions to ensure positive risks: either log/exp or sqrt/square (option logscale=).
