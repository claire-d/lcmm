News about R package lcmm :
---------------------------

Changes in Version 1.5.4 (2012-06-06):

* bug in epoce computation under solaris system solved


Changes in Version 1.5.3 (2012-06-05):

* The new function 'predict.lcmm' computes predicted values of a lcmm object in the natural outcome scale for a specified profile of covariates, and also provides confidence bands using a Monte Carlo method.

* missing data handled in hlme, lcmm and Jointlcmm using 'na.action' with attributes 1 for 'na.omit' or 2 for 'na.fail'

* bug in epoce computation with splines baseline risk function solved


Changes in Version 1.5 (2012-04-06):

* improved variable specification in the estimating functions Jointlcmm, lcmm and hlme with 
	- categorical variables using factor() 
	- variables entered as functions using I() 
	- interaction terms using "*" and ":"

* computation of the predictive accuracy measure EPOCE from a Jointlcmm object either on the training data or on external data (post-fit functions epoce and Diffepoce)

* for discrete outcomes, lcmm function now computates the posterior discrete log-likelihood and the universal approximate cross-validation criterion (UACV)

* Jointlcmm now includes two parameterizations of I-splines and piecewise-constant baseline risks functions to ensure positive risks: either log/exp or sqrt/square (option logscale=).
